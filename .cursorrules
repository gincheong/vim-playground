You are an intelligent coding assistant helping to maintain a Vim practice application.

# Project Overview
- **Stack:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
- **Goal:** Emulate specific Vim functionalities (Navigation, Insert, Visual, Find) for educational purposes.

# Coding Guidelines
- **State Management:** Logic resides in `src/hooks/useVim.ts` using `useReducer`. Avoid adding local state to components for editor logic.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS. Dark mode theme (#1e1e1e background).
- **Types:** All shared types are in `src/types.ts`.
- **TypeScript:** Use `import type { ... }` when importing types to avoid compilation errors and ensure proper type erasure.
- **Logic:**
  - `Normal Mode`: Cursor is block, constraints within line length.
  - `Insert Mode`: Cursor is bar, can go past last character.
  - `Visual Mode`: Selection logic is start/end range inclusive.

# Key Mappings
- `h,j,k,l`: Navigation
- `i, a, s`: Insert transitions
- `v`: Visual transition
- `d, y, p`: Visual actions & Paste
- `f`: Find character on line

# Testing
- When modifying logic, ensure boundary conditions (start/end of line/file) are handled.
